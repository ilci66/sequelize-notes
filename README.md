* Commenting the examples given in the docs, taking my notes
* Changed the table names in the database instead of just using { freezeTableName: true } in sequelize options
* Planning on posting the images on imgur and storing the urls in my database where I will be creating relations 
* Reading about associations, sequelize seems really cool, taking notes here on on my notebook
* Reading advanced sections on sequelize, makes it a lot easier to use SQL databases, less confusing looking
* Might add more notes in the future but for now I thik I got the basics done
